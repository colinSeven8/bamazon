# bamazon
Amazon storefront CLI app that allows a customer to make a purchase based on the item list displayed
****
## Bamazon - The What and Why
Bamazon makes it easy and convenient for a user to go online and make purchases from a list of items.
****
## Overview
Bamazon uses Node packages for CLI-table, Inquirer and MySql to allow a decent interactive experience with the storefront.
****
## Bamazon Commands
1. Type "node bamazonCustomer":
    1) It will ask you for the **ID** of the item you'd like to purchase.
    2) Next, you will need to enter in the **quantity** of the item you'd like. If there aren't enough items available, Bamazon will let you know.
    3) At this point, you can either make another purchase or press **q** to quit.
